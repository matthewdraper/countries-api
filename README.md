# Countries API Demo
I built this out using React as the main Js framework. There are some files that I would not normally commit to the 
repo, such as the `.env`. I did this to make it easier to run.


## How to use
To start the server open a terminal window on unix/linux based systems and change
directory to the project root. Then execute this command:

```
  ./server
```

:warning: This command should automatically run a `composer install` command for the project. If the command fails to
run then please run the command with the path to your installation of composer.

The command assumes you have a PHP binary in your system path. If you don't you
will get an error and the server will not start.

After starting the server go to:

```
http://localhost:8765/index.html  
```
